# Anagram Game
This midterm requirement for the CS Professional Elective 1 course is a web-based anagram game made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. The objective of the game is to guess the correct possible words which can be formed from the main word. This utilizes the shadify API, specifically the anagram generator endpoint found at https://shadify.dev/api/anagram/generator.
